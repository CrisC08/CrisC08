- 👋 Hi, I’m @CrisC08 and I'm excited to be here.
- 👀 I’m interested in learning C and Python.
-  🌱 I’m currently following the CS50 2024 course from Harvard.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on understanding how programming works.
- 📫 How to reach me: have no idea, maybe there's a chat like feature somewhere? :) 
- 😄 Pronouns: She/her
- ⚡ Fun fact: I studied languages and my intuition tells me that programming languages and natural languages have a lot in common like syntax, spelling rules etc
